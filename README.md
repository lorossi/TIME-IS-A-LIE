# TIME IS A LIE

What is time if not a collective allucination? Maybe I'm kinda going off the beaten path here...

`Time is an Illusion.: Lunchtime doubly so.` *Ford Prefect*, in one of the best books I have ever read. I tried to quote him but failed (quite miserably, if I can say so) to express his point of view. Of course he wouldn't care.

Ford Prefect tried to warn us all. "Time is an Illusion.: Lunchtime doubly so.".⠀
I can't say he was wrong, but I feel he was not correct.⠀
